# PRODIGY_ML_03
# 🐶🐱 Dogs vs. Cats Classifier

This project aims to build a binary image classification model to distinguish between dogs and cats using a deep learning model.

## 📁 Dataset

- Training Data: 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs.
- Test Data: Unlabeled images provided in `test1.zip`.
- Submission File: Predictions in `sampleSubmission.csv`, where `1` = dog and `0` = cat.

# 📊 Model Summary
Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Input Size: Resized to 128x128 or 224x224 (based on model)

Output: Binary (0 = Cat, 1 = Dog)

# 📈 Evaluation Metric
Binary Accuracy

Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy

Optimizer: Adam

# 🔒 Fairness Notice
Please refrain from manually labeling test predictions or using pretrained models specifically trained on similar datasets (e.g., Asirra). The goal is to evaluate model generalization fairly.

# 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to image classification using a labeled dataset of dogs and cats. Through proper preprocessing, data augmentation, and a well-tuned CNN, high classification accuracy can be achieved. Future improvements may include:

Use of transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet).

Hyperparameter tuning with tools like Optuna.

Real-time classification via a web or desktop app.
